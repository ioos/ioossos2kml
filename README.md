Generate user-friendly, consistent KML's from IOOS SOS Milestone 1 end points, for fixed-location stations

## Update from 2016-7-12

For anyone who happens to land on this old repo, [this Jupyter notebook (SensorMLparsing_IOOSSOS.ipynb) may be of interest](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nanoos-pnw/ioos-ws/blob/master/SensorMLparsing_IOOSSOS.ipynb). It roughly does the "first half" of what the `ioossos2kml` project was going to do: read from an IOOS SOS Milestone 1 end point DescribeSensor/SensorML response and create a common, easy-to-use data structure (a Pandas DataFrame) in Python. See [this email for additional information about the code](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ioos_tech/T3HhGNXebaA/kwTWLLBqCAAJ)
